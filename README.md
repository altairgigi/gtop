# GTOP

Gtop (Gigi's top) is a simple process viewer made in C (c99/c17).

## Installation

Download the 'gtop' file on your Linux system.

Install in /bin directory and activate permissions.

Call the 'gtop' command from your preferred terminal console.

## Purpose
Gtop is a project aimed at getting with more advanced C instructions and elements while maintaining the code DRY and compact and ensuring readability. 

Gtop includes/ensure: 
* Basic instructions and practices (cycles, control flow, structures, pointers, etc.) 
* Error handling;
* Directory & file handling;
* User input handling;
* Dynamic array;
* Function pointer;
* Array sorting (through qsort());
* Basic ANSI interface;
* More advanced libraries (ctype.h, dirent.h, termios.h etc).

## Features
Gtop is intended to be a simple top-like implementation with a user-chosen sorted visualisation.

Gtop can:
* visualise current ram and cpu loads;
* visualise tasks currently running and their cpu and ram usage;
* order tasks by PID, cpu load or ram use (depending on user input; default: cpu load).
